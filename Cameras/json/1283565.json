","long_description":"Fast, durable, and versatile, the black OM-D E-M1 Mark II from Olympus is a workhorse Micro Four Thirds mirrorless camera, offering a broad range of stills and video-minded functionality. Revolving around a high-resolution 20.4MP Live MOS sensor and TruePic VIII image processor, the E-M1 Mark II sports a truly fast 60 fps continuous shooting rate with an electronic shutter, 18 fps with continuous autofocus, and 15 fps with a mechanical shutter. For video shooters, both DCI and UHD 4K recording modes can be used, along with a Time-lapse Movie mode for producing in-camera 4K time-lapse sequences. The sensor and processor also avail a top expanded sensitivity of ISO 25600 to support shooting in difficult lighting conditions, and sensor-shift-type 5-axis image stabilization also helps to minimize the appearance of camera shake for sharper handheld shooting. Additionally, the sensor's design also incorporates 121 on-chip phase-detection points, all of which are cross-type, along with 121 contrast-detection areas for fast and precise focusing and subject tracking performance. Complementing the imaging capabilities, the E-M1 Mark II also sports a durable magnesium alloy design that is weather-resistant for working in harsh climates. The body also features both a 2.36m-dot electronic viewfinder and 3.0\" 1.04m-dot vari-angle LCD touchscreen for intuitive control and working from a variety of angles. Built-in Wi-Fi further expands sharing and remote shooting capabilities, and dual SD card slots and a USB 3.0 Type C port expand file saving and tethered shooting options.","images":{"0":"b636da91c0c2042818672d65f5809006-0.jpg","1":"b636da91c0c2042818672d65f5809006-1.jpg","2":"b636da91c0c2042818672d65f5809006-2.jpg","3":"b636da91c0c2042818672d65f5809006-3.jpg","4":"b636da91c0c2042818672d65f5809006-4.jpg","5":"b636da91c0c2042818672d65f5809006-5.jpg","6":"b636da91c0c2042818672d65f5809006-6.jpg","7":"b636da91c0c2042818672d65f5809006-7.jpg","8":"b636da91c0c2042818672d65f5809006-8.jpg","9":"b636da91c0c2042818672d65f5809006-9.jpg","10":"b636da91c0c2042818672d65f5809006-10.jpg","11":"b636da91c0c2042818672d65f5809006-11.jpg","12":"b636da91c0c2042818672d65f5809006-12.jpg","13":"b636da91c0c2042818672d65f5809006-13.jpg","14":"b636da91c0c2042818672d65f5809006-14.jpg","15":"b636da91c0c2042818672d65f5809006-15.jpg","16":"b636da91c0c2042818672d65f5809006-16.jpg","17":"b636da91c0c2042818672d65f5809006-17.jpg","18":"b636da91c0c2042818672d65f5809006-18.jpg","19":"b636da91c0c2042818672d65f5809006-19.jpg","20":"b636da91c0c2042818672d65f5809006-20.jpg","21":"b636da91c0c2042818672d65f5809006-21.jpg","22":"b636da91c0c2042818672d65f5809006-22.jpg","23":"b636da91c0c2042818672d65f5809006-23.jpg","24":"b636da91c0c2042818672d65f5809006-24.jpg","25":"b636da91c0c2042818672d65f5809006-25.jpg","26":"b636da91c0c2042818672d65f5809006-26.jpg","27":"b636da91c0c2042818672d65f5809006-27.jpg","28":"b636da91c0c2042818672d65f5809006-28.jpg"}},"configuration":{},"availability":{"1283565":{"aditional_price":0,"availabile":664}}}
