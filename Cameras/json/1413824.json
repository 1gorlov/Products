Distinguished in the series by its extended zoom, the RX100 VI sports a 24-200mm-equivalent ZEISS Vario-Sonnar T* lens covering wide-angle to telephoto focal lengths for greater shooting flexibility. Leveraging the most from the updated lens design is the 20.1MP 1\" Exmor RS CMOS sensor, along with an improved BIONZ X image processor, for fast shooting performance to 24 fps, high sensitivity to ISO 12800, and UHD 4K video recording. The sensor's design also provides a 315-point hybrid AF system for quick and accurate focus performance and subject tracking in both stills and video modes. A stacked design and front-end LSI also contribute to quickened operation and enhanced image quality. Video performance has been upgraded through the incorporation of S-Log3 and HLG gamma settings, and High Frame Rate shooting allows you to record at up to 960 fps for slow-motion playback.Even with the integrated 24-200mm, the form factor of the RX100 VI remains nearly as compact as ever, but still without sacrificing on functionality. A pop-up 2.36m-dot OLED electronic viewfinder is a sleek means for eye-level viewing or, alternatively, a 3.0\" 921.6k-dot LCD touchscreen can be used. The LCD features a tilting design to support working from high and low angles and its touch capability permits the use of Touch Focus and Touch Shutter functions. The camera also sports wireless connectivity for sharing imagery to a linked mobile device or for embedding location information from your smartphone.","images":{"0":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-0.jpg","1":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-1.jpg","2":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-2.jpg","3":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-3.jpg","4":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-4.jpg","5":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-5.jpg","6":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-6.jpg","7":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-7.jpg","8":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-8.jpg","9":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-9.jpg","10":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-10.jpg","11":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-11.jpg","12":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-12.jpg","13":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-13.jpg","14":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-14.jpg","15":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-15.jpg","16":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-16.jpg","17":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-17.jpg","18":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-18.jpg","19":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-19.jpg","20":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-20.jpg","21":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-21.jpg","22":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-22.jpg","23":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-23.jpg","24":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-24.jpg","25":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-25.jpg","26":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-26.jpg","27":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-27.jpg","28":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-28.jpg","29":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-29.jpg","30":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-30.jpg","31":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-31.jpg","32":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-32.jpg","33":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-33.jpg","34":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-34.jpg","35":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-35.jpg","36":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-36.jpg","37":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-37.jpg","38":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-38.jpg","39":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-39.jpg","40":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-40.jpg","41":"0ad3f12650ec662e409f3de57932631e-41.jpg"}},"configuration":{},"availability":{"1413824":{"aditional_price":0,"availabile":809}}}
