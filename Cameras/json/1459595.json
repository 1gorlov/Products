Featuring a revised image sensor and processor, both high-resolution stills and 4K video can be recorded while an apt autofocus system delivers quick and accurate focusing performance. The sensor, a 26.1MP APS-C-format X-Trans CMOS 4, features a back-illuminated design, to promote greater image quality throughout the sensitivity range, along with a 425-point phase-detection autofocus system for quick, precise AF performance and subject tracking. Complementing the imaging and focusing is the X-Processor 4, which uses four CPUs for faster image processing as well as continuous shooting up to 8 fps with a mechanical shutter, 30 fps shooting at a 1.25x crop and electronic shutter, and internal DCI/UHD 4K30 video recording. Sharing a familiar aesthetic of FUJIFILM X-series cameras, the X-T30 sports classically inspired looks, has prominent physical controls, and has a high-resolution 2.36m-dot OLED electronic viewfinder. Conversely, a rear 3.0\" 1.04m-dot tilting touchscreen LCD can also be used for live view shooting and larger image playback. Additionally, the X-T30 also sports built-in Bluetooth for wireless sharing and remote control.","images":{"0":"12f28c58124cc273a83bc735b4961264-0.jpg","1":"12f28c58124cc273a83bc735b4961264-1.jpg","2":"12f28c58124cc273a83bc735b4961264-2.jpg","3":"12f28c58124cc273a83bc735b4961264-3.jpg","4":"12f28c58124cc273a83bc735b4961264-4.jpg","5":"12f28c58124cc273a83bc735b4961264-5.jpg"}},"configuration":{},"availability":{"1459595":{"aditional_price":0,"availabile":278}}}
