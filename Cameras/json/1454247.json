Review Nikon Z7","long_description":"Nikon has taken the next step in their imaging journey with the Z 7 Mirrorless Camera, dubbed \"The Perfectionist,\" and the revolutionary Z System. This high-resolution FX-format camera introduces the Z Mount, a large diameter design with a short 16mm flange distance that allows Nikon to create compact, yet powerful cameras and develop more advanced optics. The Z 7 is among the first in the series, and brings with it a 45.7MP BSI CMOS sensor and EXPEED 6 Image Processing Engine, delivering outstanding image quality and speed with a native sensitivity range of ISO 64-25600.On the sensor you will find an advanced phase-detect autofocus system using 493 points covering 90% of the image area and the sensor features 5-axis Vibration Reduction technology for stabilized photos and video regardless of the lens used. This advanced hybrid AF system will also benefit video. The Z 7 features UHD 4K recording at up to 30p and can use the N-Log gamma profile along with the camera's 10-bit HDMI output to create cinema-quality video. The camera's high-resolution sensor also permits the use of an 8K Time-Lapse mode.As with many mirrorless systems, the Z Series boasts a much more compact form factor than its DSLR counterparts. The Z 7 is no exception with its slimmed down design and lighter build, though it maintains the weather sealing and ergonomics for which Nikon is known. The camera features multiple displays and screens for ease of use, including a 0.80x 3.6m-dot EVF with NIKKOR optics and a Fluorine coating, ensuring clear viewing. The rear of the camera is equipped with a 3.2\" 2.1m-dot tilting touchscreen LCD while the top offers a dot-matrix OLED for quickly checking settings. For storage, the Z 7 has a single XQD card slot that is compatible with CFexpress for faster speeds in the future. Additionally, the body is equipped with both Wi-Fi and Bluetooth.Enabling the use of nearly any Nikon F-mount lens on Z-mount mirrorless camera bodies, the FTZ Mount Adapter is a sophisticated means for expanding the range of usable lenses. While compatible with approximately 360 distinct F-mount lenses, this adapter is especially ideal for use with over 90 E, G, and D-type lenses, where it fully maintains autofocus and auto-exposure capabilities for seamless use of the SLR lenses on the mirrorless body. The adapter, which is built from magnesium alloy and is weather-sealed, also incorporates a 1/4\"-20 mount on the base to provide a more balanced means for working on a tripod with longer, heavier lenses.Supporting enhanced data read and write speed, the 64GB XQD G Series Memory Card from Sony can be used to record a variety of content up to and including 4K video. In addition to recording 4K content, the 440 MB/s read and 400 MB/s write speeds make it easy to capture photos in both burst mode and in RAW format, as well as streamline workflows. This XQD G Series Card from Sony also supports both PCI Express Gen. 2 and USB 3.0 interfaces, allowing it to be used with a wide range of devices.Store, transport, and protect your DSLR with attached lens, 2-4 extra lenses, flash, and related accessories with the black Kontrast DSLR Shoulder Bag from Case Logic. The padded main compartment has a hammock system that suspends the camera for improved shock protection, and padded, touch-fastening dividers for organizing gear. Water-resistant DuraBase, foam padding, and polyester construction ensures strength and durability. The lid unzips away from wearer for easy access to gear, and has a convenient zip pocket underneath for small items. Dual, zippered side and front pockets provide additional storage capacity. The front pocket features two slip-in pockets. Carry your Kontrast Shoulder Bag with the padded top handle, or wear with the removable, padded shoulder strap. The gray interior lining makes finding gear in low light easier.","images":{"0":"4424e08c26e3ede88f19f6a4c6624ccc-0.jpg","1":"4424e08c26e3ede88f19f6a4c6624ccc-1.jpg","2":"4424e08c26e3ede88f19f6a4c6624ccc-2.jpg","3":"4424e08c26e3ede88f19f6a4c6624ccc-3.jpg","4":"4424e08c26e3ede88f19f6a4c6624ccc-4.jpg"}},"configuration":{},"availability":{"1454247":{"aditional_price":0,"availabile":693}}}
