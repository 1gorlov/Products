Revolving around a 24.2MP APS-C CMOS sensor and DIGIC 7 image processor, images can be recorded using a broad native sensitivity range of ISO 100-25600, to suit shooting in a variety of lighting conditions, and a continuous shooting rate of 6 fps benefits working with moving subjects. The sensor's design also facilitates Dual Pixel CMOS AF, which uses phase-detection autofocus for quick, accurate, and smooth performance to suit both video shooting and stills use in live view. Alternatively, a 45-point all cross-type phase-detect AF system is also featured for shooting stills using the optical pentamirror viewfinder.In regard to the physical design, a large 3.0\" 1.04m-dot touchscreen LCD is featured for easy settings and playback control and live view monitoring, and it uses a vari-angle design to permit easier viewing from high and low working angles. A top LCD screen is also incorporated into the design for quickly recognizing your shooting settings, and a rear Quick Control dial affords more intuitive settings navigation. Additionally, built-in Wi-Fi with NFC is available for quick and convenient pairing with a smartphone or tablet for wireless image sharing, and Bluetooth is also featured for image sharing to and remote camera control from a mobile device.","images":{"0":"d64eb463fc0e1678d59dce4b438e65b0-0.jpg","1":"d64eb463fc0e1678d59dce4b438e65b0-1.jpg","2":"d64eb463fc0e1678d59dce4b438e65b0-2.jpg","3":"d64eb463fc0e1678d59dce4b438e65b0-3.jpg","4":"d64eb463fc0e1678d59dce4b438e65b0-4.jpg","5":"d64eb463fc0e1678d59dce4b438e65b0-5.jpg","6":"d64eb463fc0e1678d59dce4b438e65b0-6.jpg","7":"d64eb463fc0e1678d59dce4b438e65b0-7.jpg","8":"d64eb463fc0e1678d59dce4b438e65b0-8.jpg","9":"d64eb463fc0e1678d59dce4b438e65b0-9.jpg","10":"d64eb463fc0e1678d59dce4b438e65b0-10.jpg","11":"d64eb463fc0e1678d59dce4b438e65b0-11.jpg","12":"d64eb463fc0e1678d59dce4b438e65b0-12.jpg","13":"d64eb463fc0e1678d59dce4b438e65b0-13.jpg","14":"d64eb463fc0e1678d59dce4b438e65b0-14.jpg","15":"d64eb463fc0e1678d59dce4b438e65b0-15.jpg","16":"d64eb463fc0e1678d59dce4b438e65b0-16.jpg","17":"d64eb463fc0e1678d59dce4b438e65b0-17.jpg","18":"d64eb463fc0e1678d59dce4b438e65b0-18.jpg","19":"d64eb463fc0e1678d59dce4b438e65b0-19.jpg","20":"d64eb463fc0e1678d59dce4b438e65b0-20.jpg","21":"d64eb463fc0e1678d59dce4b438e65b0-21.jpg","22":"d64eb463fc0e1678d59dce4b438e65b0-22.jpg","23":"d64eb463fc0e1678d59dce4b438e65b0-23.jpg","24":"d64eb463fc0e1678d59dce4b438e65b0-24.jpg","25":"d64eb463fc0e1678d59dce4b438e65b0-25.jpg","26":"d64eb463fc0e1678d59dce4b438e65b0-26.jpg","27":"d64eb463fc0e1678d59dce4b438e65b0-27.jpg"}},"configuration":{},"availability":{"1318281":{"aditional_price":0,"availabile":173}}}
