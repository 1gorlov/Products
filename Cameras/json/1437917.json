The sensor and processor combination also avail fast performance throughout the camera system, including a 10-fps continuous shooting rate and UHD 4K30p video recording. Complementing the imaging is a balanced physical design, which incorporates both a pop-up OLED Tru-Finder electronic viewfinder and 180Â° tilting 3.0\" 921k-dot touchscreen LCD, along with built-in Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for wireless image sharing and remote camera control via a linked smartphone or tablet.
