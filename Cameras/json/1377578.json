Review FUJIFILM X100F","long_description":"Featuring an evolution in its core feature-set, the black X100F Digital Camera from FUJIFILM incorporates a series of advanced imaging capabilities while still retaining its trademark design and intuitive handling assets. Most notably, the X100F features a 24.3MP APS-C X-Trans CMOS III sensor and X-Processor Pro image processor to realize rich, high-resolution stills and fluent performance with expandable sensitivity to ISO 51200. A built-in Fujinon 23mm f/2 lens provides a general wide-angle 35mm equivalent focal length, and its optical design utilizes aspherical glass to produce sharp imagery while a Super EBC coating resists flare and ghosting. Benefitting working in a variety of shooting situations, a heightened hybrid autofocus system now utilizes 91 total points, including 49 phase-detection points, for quick, accurate focusing. Complementing the imaging specs is a range of physical attributes that are the hallmark of the X100-series. The Advanced Hybrid Viewfinder, which meshes both optical and electronic viewing means in a switchable manner, has been updated with adjustable magnification for the electronic rangefinder function for more precise manual focus control. Additionally, the body also sports a physical ISO dial, which is incorporated within the shutter speed dial, and the exposure compensation dial can now be set to a C position for an increased +/- 5 stop range of adjustment. Additionally, the rear of the camera sees the inclusion of a focus lever for faster focus point selection, and the majority of the physical controls, buttons, and dials have been moved to the right-hand side for easier one-handed use.Designed for SD devices that can capture Full HD, 3D, and 4K video, as well as raw and burst photography, the 64GB Extreme UHS-I SDXC Memory Card from SanDisk has a capacity of 64GB, is compatible with the UHS-I bus, and features a speed class rating of V30, which guarantees minimum write speeds of 30 MB/s. If your device does not support the V30 standard, this card also supports the U3 standard, which likewise guarantees minimum write speeds of 30 MB/s. Read speeds are supported up to 150 MB/s and write speeds max out at 60 MB/s. A built-in write-protect switch helps to safeguard against the accidental erasure of card data. While this card has been designed for cameras that are UHS-I / V30 / U3 compatible, it may be used in devices that do not support UHS-I / V30 / U3. However, bear in mind that this card will then default to your device's speed class and bus rating, such as UHS-I and U1, which supports minimum write speeds of 10 MB/s, or Class 10, which also supports minimum write speeds of 10 MB/s.Store, transport and protect your digital mirrorless or bridge camera from moisture, dirt and dust with the black Lyra 60 Camera Pouch from Ruggard.
