Review Sony DSC-RX100 VA","long_description":"Tweaking an already stellar pocket-sized camera, the Cyber-shot DSC-RX100 VA Digital Camera from Sony improves the existing RX100 V by increasing the buffer size to 233 images, reducing display lag time in the electronic viewfinder, and adding several small features over other aspects of the camera. With the 20.1MP 1\" Exmor RS BSI CMOS sensor, the RX100 VA can output detailed images at sensitivities up to ISO 12800. The Fast Hybrid AF system has 315 focal-plane phase-detection points that cover 65% of the image area of the sensor and can achieve focus in as little as 0.05 seconds. That autofocus system is also capable of tracking subjects across the frame, even while shooting at high speeds. Sony's BIONZ X processor enables continuous shooting up to 24 fps with the aforementioned buffer size of 233 JPEG images and improved High Frame Rate recording times.Like the RX100 V, the RX100 VA can shoot HD video at 960 fps in High Frame Rate Mode and UHD 4K video at 30/24 fps. But a new feature of the RX100 VA is dual video recording, where the camera simultaneously records two video files at once. Also carried over from the RX100 V is Gamma Display Assist, which provides a more contrasty image while using a flat S-Log2 gamma, and the Photo Capture mode for pulling 8.29MP stills from your movies.The RX100 VA keeps the same physical design as the RX100 V to keep compatibility with all accessories. A Zeiss Vario-Sonnar T* lens still graces the front of the camera with an equivalent zoom range of 24-70mm and a fast f/1.8-2.8 maximum aperture that provides incredible flexibility in a wide range of shooting scenarios. A pop-up 0.39\" 2.36m-dot OLED Tru-Finder EVF and 3.0\" 1.23m-dot tilting LCD give you crystal clear previews of what you're shooting. The RX100 VA also keeps the same lens control ring, built-in ND filter, and customizable buttons as its predecessor. It also has Wi-Fi and NFC capabilities for connecting to a smartphone.Built to meet the demands of photographers and passionate shutterbugs who are using advanced cameras and HD camcorders, the 32GB Extreme UHS-I SDHC Memory Card  from SanDisk allows users to take advantage of functions such as fast action shots, continuous burst mode, and multiple frames per second.
