Review Panasonic DC-LX100 II","long_description":"With exceptional image quality and a compact design, this Lumix DC-LX100 II Digital Camera from Panasonic improves upon its predecessor while keeping many of its most beloved qualities. At the forefront is the large 17MP 4/3\" image sensor that outputs detailed still images and captures brilliant 4K video at 24 or 30 fps. The built-in Leica DC Vario-Summilux lens has a zoom range of 24-75mm (35mm equivalent) and a bright f/1.7-2.8 aperture range, making it more than capable of handling a variety of low-light scenarios. Full manual control over exposure via on-camera dials allows for greater creative freedom by allowing you to keep your eyes looking through the 2760k-dot electronic viewfinder instead of flipping through menus. The 3\" LCD touchscreen can also be used to adjust settings as well as autofocus.","images":{"0":"2c87469f07c36293286762cce39b7a95-0.jpg","1":"2c87469f07c36293286762cce39b7a95-1.jpg","2":"2c87469f07c36293286762cce39b7a95-2.jpg","3":"2c87469f07c36293286762cce39b7a95-3.jpg","4":"2c87469f07c36293286762cce39b7a95-4.jpg","5":"2c87469f07c36293286762cce39b7a95-5.jpg","6":"2c87469f07c36293286762cce39b7a95-6.jpg"}},"configuration":{},"availability":{"1428270":{"aditional_price":0,"availabile":403}}}
