Review Canon 80D","long_description":"Characterized by versatile imaging specs, the Canon EOS 80D further clarifies itself using a pair of robust focusing systems and an intuitive design. Featuring a 24.2MP APS-C CMOS sensor and DIGIC 6 image processor, this sleek DSLR is capable of capturing high-resolution images at up to 7 fps and Full HD 1080p60 video, both with reduced noise and high sensitivity up to an expanded ISO 25600 for working in difficult lighting conditions. When working with the optical viewfinder, an apt 45-point all cross-type AF system affords fast performance in a range of lighting conditions for tracking moving subjects and working in low light, while the Dual Pixel CMOS AF system benefits live view shooting and movie recording by providing a smooth, natural focusing quality akin to the way a camcorder acquires focus. Touch-to-focus is availed by the large 3.0\" 1.04m-dot touchscreen LCD, which also sports a swiveling vari-angle design for working from high and low angles with ease. Additionally, built-in Wi-Fi with NFC allows you to pair mobile devices with the camera to wirelessly transfer files for sharing your photos and movies online. More than just a well-connected DSLR, the 80D is equally matched in imaging versatility due to its inclusion of multimedia feature-sets for stills shooting and movie recording.Included with the camera body is the EF-S 18-55mm f/3.5-5.6 IS STM lens; a versatile everyday lens that encompasses a 28.8-88mm equivalent focal length range. The STM stepping motor helps to achieve near-silent focusing when used during video recording and the Optical Image Stabilizer system helps to minimize the appearance of camera shake.","images":{"0":"acd3bc89a44a21c0f13e6827071b7b6f-0.jpg","1":"acd3bc89a44a21c0f13e6827071b7b6f-1.jpg","2":"acd3bc89a44a21c0f13e6827071b7b6f-2.jpg","3":"acd3bc89a44a21c0f13e6827071b7b6f-3.jpg","4":"acd3bc89a44a21c0f13e6827071b7b6f-4.jpg","5":"acd3bc89a44a21c0f13e6827071b7b6f-5.jpg","6":"acd3bc89a44a21c0f13e6827071b7b6f-6.jpg","7":"acd3bc89a44a21c0f13e6827071b7b6f-7.jpg","8":"acd3bc89a44a21c0f13e6827071b7b6f-8.jpg","9":"acd3bc89a44a21c0f13e6827071b7b6f-9.jpg","10":"acd3bc89a44a21c0f13e6827071b7b6f-10.jpg","11":"acd3bc89a44a21c0f13e6827071b7b6f-11.jpg","12":"acd3bc89a44a21c0f13e6827071b7b6f-12.jpg","13":"acd3bc89a44a21c0f13e6827071b7b6f-13.jpg","14":"acd3bc89a44a21c0f13e6827071b7b6f-14.jpg","15":"acd3bc89a44a21c0f13e6827071b7b6f-15.jpg","16":"acd3bc89a44a21c0f13e6827071b7b6f-16.jpg"}},"configuration":{},"availability":{"1225876":{"aditional_price":0,"availabile":641}}}
