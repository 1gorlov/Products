The ZBook Studio G3 will help users stay productive, whether they are at home, at the office, or in the field, and it is powered by a 2.8 GHz Intel Xeon E3-1505M v5 Quad-Core processor that allows you to run multiple applications simultaneously. Using Intel Turbo Boost 2.0 technology, the processor is capable of boosting to 3.7 GHz if more power is needed. The 16GB of 2133 MHz DDR4 ECC RAM helps to ensure smooth multitasking and also allows the computer to quickly access frequently-used files and programs. The current memory configuration is 2 x 8GB 260-pin SO-DIMM memory modules with two additional slots that are available for memory upgrades. With all four slots in use, this system can support 64GB, or 16GB per slot. The 15.6\" UWVA anti-glare display features an Ultra HD 3840 x 2160 native resolution. The Ultra HD display also features IPS technology, LED-backlighting, and a 16:9 aspect ratio. The dedicated NVIDIA Quadro M2000M graphics card has 4GB of discrete GDDR5 RAM and delivers a sharp, clear picture. You'll also be able to output video to an external display at resolutions up to 5120 x 2880 using the system's HDMI and dual Thunderbolt 3 ports. For storage of your files, this ZBook G3 is equipped with a 256GB Z Turbo Drive PCIe SSD which offers quick access to your data. While the SSD may not have the larger storage capacity of a traditional spinning disk, it contains no moving parts, which helps it to be more resistant against bumps, drops, and other kinds of damage. SSDs also receive less wear and tear than traditional hard drives, as they never come into contact with read and write heads. Additionally, as this SSD connects via PCIe as compared to SATA, it is able to operate with even greater data transfer speeds. It provides sequential reads up to 2150 MB/s and sequential writes up to 1260 MB/s. If you want to add external storage, optical drives, memory card readers, and more, the ZBook Studio G3 offers two USB Type-C connectors that support 40 Gb/s Thunderbolt 3 and 10 Gb/s USB 3.1. There are also two 5 Gb/s USB 3.0 Type-A ports and one USB 3.0 Type-A charging port. Gigabit Ethernet and 802.11ac Wi-Fi are also built-in for wired and wireless networking and Bluetooth 4.2 technology will also allow you to connect additional compatible peripherals.
