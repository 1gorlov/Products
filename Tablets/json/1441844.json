Review Apple iPad Pro","long_description":"The 12.9\" iPad Pro from Apple, updated from the same one you know and love, ditches the Home button for a display that's more screen and less bezel. Built with the same Liquid Retina technology found on iPhones, the iPad Pro's 12.9\" display features a 2732 x 2048 resolution, ProMotion technology, wide color and True Tone support, as well as a 600 cd/m2 brightness rating. Performance-wise, Apple has replaced the A10X processor with the A12X Bionic chip. This multi-core processor handles all the computational and graphical processing needed for complicated tasks. In addition, it's paired with a Neural Engine chip for advanced machine learning. With the removal of the Home button which also functioned as the fingerprint sensor, the iPad Pro has opted for Face ID via its front-facing 7MP TrueDepth camera. Lastly, Apple has opted for a USB Type-C connector rather than its traditional Lightning connector for additional features and broader compatibility with other devices.
