Review Apple iPad Pro","long_description":"The updated 12.9\" iPad Pro from Apple features a redesigned display and updated hardware to accelerate and enhance user experience. Its display has a resolution of 2732 x 2048, a brightness of 600 cd/m2, support for the P3 color gamut, an anti-reflective coating, and a 120 Hz refresh rate thanks to ProMotion technology. A faster refresh rate delivers fluid interactions for both your finger and the Apple Pencil so you can draw and write naturally without lag as you would on paper.  Powering the iPad is the Apple A10X chip, which consists of a 6-core CPU and a 12-core GPU. This 64-bit chip can deliver desktop-class CPU performance and console-class graphics. The faster performance allows you to multitask with ease using iOS features such as Picture in Picture, Slide Over, and Split View. Also, the iPad Pro is capable of editing 4K video, rendering 3D models/images, creating/editing complex documents and presentations, and playing games. For your files, apps, photos, and more, it's equipped with 256GB of flash storage.  The iPad Pro comes with iOS installed, which features proactive assistance as well as powerful search and improved Siri features, all while protecting your privacy. There are multitasking features designed specifically for iPad which allow you to use multiple apps simultaneously, and built-in apps become more powerful with Notes, detailed transit information in Maps, and the News app. The foundation of iOS is even stronger with software updates that require less space to install and advanced security features to further protect your device.  While the Retina Display of the iPad Pro features multi-touch capabilities, Apple does offer alternative ways of interacting with the iPad Pro. The Apple Pencil is an optional accessory that can capture twice as many data points as your finger for greater precision. Force and tilt sensors transmit precise information to the iPad Pro so you can intuitively lay down lines of varying thickness and opacity. The Smart Keyboard is another optional accessory that connects to the Smart Connector on the iPad Pro, which means you don't have to use Bluetooth. The Smart Keyboard has Apple's dome switches for precision typing. The Apple 12.9\" iPad Pro includes a Lightning to USB cable and a USB power adapter. Protection is provided by a limited 1-year warranty, which can be extended using AppleCare.  This iPad comes preloaded with iOS. Please check your device settings for the latest available update.","images":{"0":"908f393b89a8505a5a68e0af537ef41f-0.jpg","1":"908f393b89a8505a5a68e0af537ef41f-1.jpg"}},"configuration":{},"availability":{"1342545":{"aditional_price":0,"availabile":629}}}
