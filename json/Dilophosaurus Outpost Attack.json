We're sorry to hear you had some frustration with the set. We always value feedback from our fans, and we'll make sure to pass it along to our design team.Some parts of this set - like the watchtower and the gate - are actually designed to come apart easier than most LEGOÂ® builds. That's because we wanted builders to be able to recreate a dino attack. Even fences and walls can't keep the terrifying Dilophasaurus back!","img":"/img/Dilophosaurus Outpost Attack.jpg"}
