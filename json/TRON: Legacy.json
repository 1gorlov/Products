This set was created with a great platform, similar to the TRON grid in the cyberworld and allows for the illusion of the hovering Light Cycles. The minifigures can sit on the bike or take the battle to the grid, Quorra and Sam Flynn can even go off grid just like in the movie. We really appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback and will pass it along to our designers. ","img":"/img/TRON: Legacy.jpg"}
