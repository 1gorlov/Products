We appreciate the feedback!The Sandcrawler™ has an iconic shape, and we've employed some pretty creative building techniques to recreate it. So for the best results, you'll want to pick up the Sandcrawler from the bottom, not from the top or sides.If you're still having trouble even when holding it from the bottom, then there's a chance something might be a little off in the build.If you need a hand troubleshooting the build, give us at shout at LEGO.comService.","img":"/img/Sandcrawler™.jpg"}
