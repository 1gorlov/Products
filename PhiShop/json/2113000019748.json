We add Olive to the intended pigment if we are working over old reddish microblading.\r- If we want to make grey colour warmer, one month after healing we can go over the strokes with Orange shade.\r- Yellow can also be used as a mask after the treatment. In this way we make the fresh colour that is very dark less intense during the first 7 days.\rcontains 2 pieces of 5ml pigment","images":{"0":"c51be930f1e79e34130bf6b6f614ebc7-0.jpg"}}
