Brown 2 is a mixture of equal amounts of yellow, black and red, which makes it possible to adapt to different eyebrow colours in the skin, with the aid of natural pigment.","long_description":"┬áBy rule, Brown 2 is used with natural brunettes. However, with different pigment dosing (different filling in the skin), it can also be used with blondes (in small doses) and clients with black hair (more filling).
