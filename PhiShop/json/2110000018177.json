It helps the fight against wrinkles and slows down the aging process of the skin.\rPhi Royal Care also contains natural coenzyme Q10, contained by all cells in our body. Our body produces this coenzyme in sufficient quantities until the age of 30. Its production reduces with aging, so it is compensated by food or food supplements. Known as the vitamin of youth – it acts as an antioxidant, neutralising the effects of free radicals that damage the cells and cause the aging of the skin. Q10 provides the skin cells with the energy necessary for protection and regeneration.\rDue to a careful selection of ingredients, in addition to essential rose oil and natural coenzyme Q10, other components of the product are the “champions” in the fight against the aging of the skin: Bee Wax, Cocoa Butter, Shi Butter, cold pressed plant oils of carrot, avocado, grape seed, olive fruit and leaf, soy, wild marine pomegranate, essential oils of immortelle, artemisia, rosemary, lavender. Phi Royal Care does not contain water, preservatives, emulsifiers, synthetic fragrances, or any other synthetic substances. The cream has a very pleasant scent. Phi Royal Care is intended for both men and women over 30 for all skin types.\rUse:Apply to wet skin by gentle rubbing.\r \rIngredients (INCI):CeraAlba, Theobroma Cocoa (Cocoa) Seed Butter, Butyrospermum, PerseaGratissima(Avocado)Oil, VitisVinifera (Grape) Seed Oil, PunicaGranatum (Pomegranate) Seed Oil, Glycine Soja (Soybean) Oil, DaucusCarota Sativa (Carrot) Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Fruit Oil, Olea Europaea (Olive) Leaf Oil, Ubiquinone, Rosa Damascena (Rose) Oil, LavandulaAngustifolia (Lavender) Oil, HelichrysumItalicum Oil, Rosmarinus Officinalis (Rosemary) Oil, Artemisia Annua(Artemisiaannua) Oil.","images":{"0":"cd597ce07797e319c203fc604f442cf5-0.jpg"}}
