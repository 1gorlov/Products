The less bleeding, the better healed results. The formulation is packed in a mild tonic containing 10% neutral shampoo (green soap) (used to easily remove the pigment from the skin during treatment). 10 minutes after the treatment, after the tonic is completely dried, a protective layer is formed on the skin surface. Its function is to protect the wound from the dust and sweat during the first 30 minutes until the client begins with the post-treatment care. Block Tonic is packaged in 5ml monodoses for one-time use, ideal for treatment (10 cotton pads).","long_description":"The basic function of the tonicum is to slow down bleeding and thus prevent the formation of large crusts - even if the client does not properly care for the eyebrows after the treatment.
